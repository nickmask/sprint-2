SCRUM

What Interests Me?

I love that the coding process is so team orientated. For me I love team work, so seeing that teams get together often and plan closely really excites me. 

After looking at the videos and going over the way it works, it all makes a lot of sense to me. The way tasks are split up into the "product backlog" and then into "sprints" makes a whole lot of sense and I can see that as something that would not just work in programming but in business applications as well. 

What Confuses Me?

I actually think i get it pretty well. I know there will be questions when I start doing it but I am pretty good now!
