UCD

Which principles seem most important to you?

Coming from a background of "customer focused" marketing I see "designing for the user", "being consistant" and "reduce unnecessary mental effort" as key princibles. I the end the app is about the user and their interaction and I see it all as very important. 

Are there any with which you disagree or feel are unimportant or less important?
All these principles I see as almost common sense. While sure, some are vital and some just help to make a good app, they are all very necessary.

Are there any which surprised you?
Nope! None at all.

ROI of UCD

What surprised you?
I don't think anything there was very surprising to me.

Does this change your view of web and software development?
It does change the importance I would put on preplanning, especially with large products that have a lot of time and money put into them. It is simply too costly to go down the trial and error route. You really need to make a solid plan and then follow through.
