I rememeber a time at work where a friend was having a really tough time. Just work load was huge, customers were bad and she was feeling really down. We just sat in a room and talked about it together. I had been in that situation as well and I tried to help her see that it wasn't her, sometimes these things get tough but she is tougher and can get through it. We just shared experiences.

Was it difficult?

I guess it is always it a bit hard to talk about times when you have been down and in the dumps and nothing is going right. I guess we all just like to forget about those times so bringing them up is always a bit hard.

Was it worth it? Why or why not?

Of course. It not only helps a friend and helps to bring you closer, but also helps your memory of that time when you were in a tough place. Makes you realise you aren't alone either.
