What social capital is?

It is the mutual reliance and the underlying connectedness that builds trust for each other.

How important do you think trust and empathy are to your success in life?

Very very important. I feel that when I am with people I trust and are empathetic to my needs (and vice versa), but happiness goes up. I is very obviouos when someone doesnt care about you. You can feel it in the way they speak and their body language and it doesnt feel good. I find that when I am wokring with people who I have a real relationship with, I am much more productive, I help them where ever possible and we get more work done.
