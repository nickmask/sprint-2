What do you think?

I think gener neutrality is important. My girl friend works in law and so I know the imporance of removing masculine language from the law, which should be unbiased, and can only see a positive change from doing that in our workplace. 

We have to realise that especially in some industries that are male orientated, women are coming in on the back food. So using language that pushes that doesn't help the situation one bit. 

But I also think that hyper-sensitivity is a problem that we can face. I often use the term "hey guys" and to me it has become gender neutral. I can see on both sides that a) this is just language development and has changed meaning like a million other words in our vocabulary, but also b) that it has the potential to exclude or offend, so why would I not try and correct myself. I do believe that making a big deal of an occational slip up is also not great and causes more issues than it helps. Again, i think that it is important, but do beleive we need to be careful not to become hypersensitive to ever little thing. 

Do you make an effort to use gender neutral language?

Yes. Most of the time I do make a big effort. My mum is a trades person, in a very masculine world and I do find it noticable when they are all refered to as "tradesmen". 

What do you think when you hear non-gender-neutral language?

Depends on what it is. I think that I do notices and would prefer gender neutral words when refering to roles and positions as that is kind of like saying "This is a mans place, not a womens". However in an informal setting when I say something along the lines of "Hey guys" i wouldnt notice because there is obviously no gender bias happening. I am not saying "Oh well, I am only really friends with guys", I am just saying hello.
