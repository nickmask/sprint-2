What is the rule for underlining text that is not a link?

Always reserve the unline for links. If you don't it will mislead people into thinking they are links.

How should the unvisited link color compare to the visited link color in terms of:

Brightness - Brighter and more "alive"

Hue - more vivid and clear

Visibility to color-blind users - brigher and more luminous.

What is a "perceived affordance"? Hint: Google is your friend. (OK, not really, but the search is nice.)

It is what people naturally perceive to be something. They perceive that blue text means it is clickable as that is the way it has always been. 

When can you safely eliminate underlines for links?

In navigation areas where it is obvious that they are links.

Should you use blue for text? Why or why not?

No, becuase it is the strongest perceived affordance of clickability. It is likely to confuse.

If for some shocking reason, your contextual links are not underlined (horrors!), what can you do to improve link discovery by users?

You can use hover effects (underline on hover but not bold)

What are link titles and how might you use them?

They pop up on a hover and tell me where I am going. They are used to strengthen a link and help users understand where they are being sent.
